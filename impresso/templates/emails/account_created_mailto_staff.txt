Hi there,

A new user has created an account on Impresso:

* First name: {{ user.first_name}}
* Last name: {{ user.last_name}}
* Email: {{ user.email}}
* Chosen plan: {{ plan_label }}

{% if email_being_sent_without_error %}
The receipt email to the user was sent successfully without any errors.
{% else %}
There was an error sending the email. Please check the server logs for more details.
{% endif %}

Link to Admin Dashboard to activate the user:
{{ absolute_admin_url_to_handle_change_request }}

Please note that the plan is already selected from the user, as this is not a change plan 
request.
This means that **as soon as users are set as "active", the plan they chose will be 
automatically validated**.
In case of doubts, DO NOT ACTIVATE the user and contact them via email.

Best regards,
The Impresso Team
