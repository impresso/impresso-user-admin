Dear {{user.first_name}},

Thank you for requesting a change to your Impresso plan. We've received your request to switch to the *{{ plan_to_name }}* plan.

We are now processing your request. This usually takes 1-2 business days.

Upon successful completion of the plan change, your permissions will be updated to reflect the {{ plan_to_name }} features.

Have a look at the Corpus Overview page: https://impresso-project.ch/datalab/corpus-overview to see what you can do with your new plan.

We will send you another email once your plan has been successfully updated.

If you have any questions or need to cancel your request, please contact our support team at {{ from_email }}.

With best wishes,
The Impresso team
