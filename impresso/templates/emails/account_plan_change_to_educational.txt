Dear {{user.first_name}},

Thank you for requesting a change to your Impresso plan. We've received your request to switch from the [Current Plan Name] plan to the [New Plan Name] plan.

We are now processing your request. This usually takes 1-2 business days.

In the meantime, here's a summary of the changes you requested:

*   Current Plan: {{ plan_from_name }}
*   Requested Plan: {{ plan_to_name }}

Upon successful completion of the plan change, your permission will be updated to reflect the {{ plan_to_name }} features
according to the Corpus Overview page: https://impresso-project.ch/datalab/corpus-overview.

We will send you another email once your plan has been successfully updated.

If you have any questions or need to cancel your request, please contact our support team at {{ from_email }}.

With best wishes,

The Impresso team
